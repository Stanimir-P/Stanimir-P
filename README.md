# Introduction

Welcome to my GitHub account, I'm Stanimir Pavlov, a passionate and dedicated developer, who always looks to learn and improve. I am currently specialising in the Web Front-End development. Apart from the Web Apps I also have an interest in Mobile Apps, something I am planning to look into the future. In 2021 I completed the JavaScript path in SoftUni and also had a basic overview of Node.js and NoSQL databases. My goal is becoming a Full Stack developer and I find mastering the Front-End is a good first step.

# Tech Stack

I am currently working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Redux, Jest, Material UI and Git. Also using some small libraries like typestyle, lodash, formik, etc...
